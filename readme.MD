# âš  Unofficial support

You should really be using the [built-in OBS Virtual Camera](https://obsproject.com/kb/virtual-camera-guide) over this plugin. This is used as a stop-gap for things that don't yet work with the built-in Virtual Camera (like multi-camera support, ~~<https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/3635> and <https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/19746>~~). I do not plan on supporting this fork outside of necessary updates if OBS breaks the plugin. And only plan on doing so until the aforementionned OpenCV issue is fixed.

# Build

You first need to install [cmake](https://cmake.org/download/), [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), and [build OBS project](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/wiki/Install-Instructions#building-obs-studio).  
You must also download `windows-deps-2024-05-08-x64` and `windows-deps-qt6-2024-05-08-x64` from [OBS Deps](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-deps/releases/tag/2024-05-08), then extract the zip as a folder of the same name and place them in `<project_root>/obs-deps/`

* **QTDIR** (path): QT folder
* **DepsPath** (path): FFmpeg folder in OBS dependencies package
* **LIBOBS_INCLUDE_DIR** (path) : Libobs include folder
* **LIBOBS_LIB** (filepath) : obs.lib path
* **OBS_FRONTEND_LIB** (filepath): obs-frontend-api.lib path

ie:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build64 `
  -DQTDIR=<...>/obs-deps/windows-deps-qt6-2024-05-08-x64 `
  -DDepsPath=<...>/obs-deps/windows-deps-2024-05-08-x64 `
  -DLIBOBS_INCLUDE_DIR=<...>/obs-studio/libobs `
  -DLIBOBS_LIB=<...>/obs-studio/build64/libobs/RelWithDebInfo/obs.lib `
  -DOBS_FRONTEND_LIB=<...>/obs-studio/build64/UI/obs-frontend-api/RelWithDebInfo/obs-frontend-api.lib `
  -DPTHREAD_LIB=<...>/obs-studio/build64/deps/w32-pthreads/RelWithDebInfo/w32-pthreads.lib
```

Run msbuild: `msbuild /m /p:Configuration=RelWithDebInfo ./build64/obs-virtualcam.sln`
